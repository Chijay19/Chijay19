                <p class="first"> After our graduation ceremony for the graduates of Batch 2022â€“2023 this is my picture. I am a with honor when I graduated from senior high school 
                    in the strand Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). Before I arrived at that point, my trip had been challenging and long. I had experienced 
                    numerous setbacks and regrets that made me want to give up. Despite the difficulties and setbacks I encountered along the way, I was incredibly grateful for the 
                    favor that the All-Powerful God had bestowed upon me since he never abandoned me. I was appreciative of my strength and knowledge for enabling me to endure till the very end.

                    in all of our professional and personal decisions. They constantly support us in pursuing our aspirations and objectives in life, and they instill in us the value of
                    working hard to differentiate ourselves from them and lead better lives. They also teach me to constantly be grateful for what we have and to maintain our humility. 
                    My family is the source of my inspiration to pursue my life goals, and I genuinely adore them.
